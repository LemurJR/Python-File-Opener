This is my first time trying out Tkinter! This is a program to open up the files you chose and saves to a file for next use!

**How To Install**
1. Click on this link *https://www.python.org*
2. Click on downloads and then pick the latest version with your OS
3. On the repository click **Code** and then **Download**
4. Unzip the folder but do **Not** unzip it to your downloads folder
5. Open up the folder and run the **open-gui.py** file
6. Click **Open File** and chose a file or files to open
7. Click **Run Apps** and then it will open the files
8. Once you exit out of the GUI it will save the last files you chose to a .txt file
9. **Note** to get rid of the saved files you must delete the save.txt file and then launch the GUI
